          "I tried Liquid-Plumr Foaming Clog Destroyer on a slow flow sink, because my usual product was sold out. The issue is unkown, but believed to be large objects getting stuck in the drain, slowing the flow. This product did absolutely nothing for me. Not even a temporary fix. I bought Liquid-Plumr Urgent clear (the product I usually use), the next day and worked like a charm. Honestly, I don't know if this product is good for any specific issue, but Urgent Clear has worked for me for many different types of clogs on both Tubs and sinks in houses and apartments without any issues at all. And Urgent clear is much faster than this product. I would advise this company to ditch this product and produce more Urgent Clears.",

          "I've used alot of drain cleaners over the years, and this one is the best. I have a bathroom sink in my apt. that tends to run slow if I don't keep up with maintenance. Some products don't do the job, this one cleared the drain completely. I was impressed. I let the foam sit for an hour, then poured 2 pots of hot water down the drain, and the sink drained quickly after the 2nd pot of hot water. The drainage has been clear ever since. This is the only brand, with pro strength foam, that I will use from now on.",

          "I'm sure I'm like many other people who have purchased this product. I was seduced by the double action it promised! If two ingredients have to be kept separate, then when you finally do mobile them there must be some big effect, right? Something powerful enough to smash through anything that could possibly be clogging my bathroom sink drain! Yeah, wrong! This Liquid Plumber Foaming Pipe Snake a Clog Remover did absolutely nothing for my clogged bathroom sink drain. See they name it something like \"pipe snake\" to make you think it's as good as the tools a plumber uses, but at a fraction of the cost of a house call. I think that's pretty awful. In no way does this stuff snake out your drain. It didn't even budge the clog in mine. On top of being disappointed, I had to face my laughing husband ( who actually is a plumber) when my easy miracle cute didn't work at all. I had been asking him to fix the sink drain in our bathroom for about a week when I picked this stuff up Ina run to the store. I was sure I was going to prove him wrong and show him that even if he couldn't make time to fix stuff around the house for me, well I could just figure it out myself. Nope. I sure couldn't. This stuff was a total waste. Next time I'll just wait, or pester him harder.",

          "I purchased Liquid-Plumr Foaming Pipe Snake Clog Remover for my mother. She had a clogged shower drain and this was the first product I saw in the store. I followed the directions and poured a little less than half of the bottle down the drain. Since it was a very clogged drain most of the liquid was visible in the tub. I waited for 30 minutes for the liquid to work it's way through the clog. I came to see that the liquid was still in the tub. I decided to give it an hour and come back to check on it. An hour later and the liquid had went down the drain. I ran some water in the shower to see if the clog had been eradicated. After running water for a couple of seconds the liquid came right back through the drain. I left the drain alone for 24 hours. The following day I poured the rest of the solution into the tub and left it alone for the entire day. I came back to the tub about 12 hours later to see if the solution had made progress. Nothing had changed and the liquid was still sitting in the tub. I wouldn't recommend Liquid-Plumr Foaming Pipe Snake Clog Remover.",

          "As far as CURRENTLY available drain cleaning products go, Liquid Plumr Foaming Pipe Snake works ok. That's not saying much. When I was younger you could go get a regular can of \"Drano\" crystals and they worked great. They fizzed and got really hot, so you had to stay back, but the toughest clogs were gone in no time. These newer products, particularly the liquid and foaming ones, don't work anywhere near as good as the old fashioned crystals. Even the newer crystal products don't work as good as they used to. I really think the formula has changed. Performance As I mentioned above, I'll give it a few points just for being relatively effective when compared to other products available today at the store. However, it doesn't really work that well. Nothing out there does. Scent I'll give it a six, just because it doesn't smell any WORSE than other comparable products, but REALLY? Who wants to SMELL their drain cleaner?? People go out of their way NOT to smell it. The less scent the better. Do they even add fragrance to these things at all?",

          "Liquid Plummer Foaming Pipe Snake Clog Remover actually does what the name says it does, and is so much easier than having to do the actual manual snaking of the pipe. This product is worth every penny you spend on it, which is not a lot of pennies. Performance This product works so well. It really is pour, wait, rinse and it works just as good, if not better than if you snaked the pipe yourself. It cleans the pipe out in no time. I have used it in the kitchen sink once, and that was right after I got the maintenance to snake it, and it worked for like a day then it was clogged again, and it cleared up and I never had a problem after that. The foaming action really clears out the entire circumference of the pipe, guaranteeing optimal flow and preventing a near future blockage. Scent I honestly don't remember there being an odor to this product. If there was one, it wasn't one that you will remember or be disturbed over for a long time afterwards.",

When I arrived I grabbed the bottle and slowly put the grocery bags on the kitchen counter. I opened the cap and started (slowly) pouring. The bubbles were mesmerizing. I made dinner (slow oven roasted vegetables, rice, carrot mixed with yogurt, ground meat tomato sauce heated slowly in the microwave) . I forgot about the slow drain. I remembered, got up and waited as my kettle heated up water slowly. After it finished heating I (slowly) poured it into the sink. MMMMMMMM. I opened the faucet and watched the water drain slowly after a while it was working like it used to. It was a good day.',

          "Every six months to a year or so, my upstairs bathroom sink starts to drain slowly. And more slowly. And more slowly. It's never fully clogged, but rather seems to just have a buildup of gunk from all the toothpaste and shaving cream, etc. that gets washed down into the pipes day in and day out. When this happens, I always reach for Liquid-Plumr Professional Strength Foaming Pipe Snake. Liquid-Plumr Professional Strength Foaming Pipe Snake is of course very easy to use; you just uncap it and dump the entire bottle down the drain. A little bit of foam often washes back into the sink as the two liquids join to do their magical foaming action. I actually like the way it smells, which is unusual for a household chemical, but it has a very fresh clean scent, with a whiff of what I think might be hydrogen peroxide. The bottle says to let it sit for an hour, but I usually leave it several hours. Then a nice thorough flush with hot tap water, and my drain is running like a dream! I've never had anything other than perfect results with Liquid-Plumr Professional Strength Foaming Pipe Snake. I wish I didn't have to use it twice a year or so, but it's certainly cheaper than calling a plumber!",

          'I was looking for a drain cleaner as all my "household hints" measures had failed. I didn\'t look carefully and brought this home. It cleared my clog instantly. I was surprised when I read it was recommended for slow drains. This kitchen drain had been slow since I moved here and I assumed, since this house is 100 years old, I would have to accept that it would be slow. After using this product I no longer have to reduce the flow of water. So happy!',

However, within a couple weeks, it was back just as bad as before, so I assume it only slightly opened the clog. I am going to buy it again and try once more.",

          "i agree with the other reviewers! this is a great product! i have been using the liquid-plumr professional strength foaming snake pipe for probably 5 years now and am really thrilled with the results! now side note: if you have daughters with long hair that continually clog the drains with their hair, you might want to \"invest\" (not really because they cost about 99 cents at the home depot or lowes) in one of those white plastic combs that have sharp teeth on the edge to put down the drain first. other than the really tough clogs...but for the kind-of-tough clogs, this is a perfect product! the two different ingredients mix together to form a powerful gel like liquid. whenever i've used it and followed directions (especially running the HOT water after waiting for the hour or so) the gel has worked it's magic and the drain....whether kitchen or bath...runs smooth as silk! high praise!",

It clears any kind of clog and it is very effective, although you will have to wait around 30 minutes to use your sink. It is my product of choice for declotting and I will recommend very positively. It can be found in general and department stores , pharmacies and supermarkets as wells for a very good price.",

Therefore, this product did not work on my hair and our drain. If you have normal hair and normal water (did I mention our water supply comes from a marsh?), I'm sure it works fine for you. However, it only works for our standard clogs and not our super hair plus gross water clogs.",

          "It just occured to me that we have SIX sinks in our household. All but one have been clogged at one time or another. We've used Liquid Plumr Foaming Pipe Snake on three of them, with... are you ready? ZERO results. Yes, we followed the directions to the T. I know exactly what you're thinking. NO, there are no foreign objects being stuck down these sinks. I myself, have psoriasis, which causes my hair to fall out periodically, but it's just hair, and any numbers of chemicals can deminish THAT. Liquid Plumr seems like they are selling water and cornstarch in these cool-looking bottles and trying to pass it off as something it's just not. We went through TWO bottles of the stuff on my girls' sink, and there was still absolutely no improvement whatsoever. The front of the bottle had said that if it doesn't work we could get our money back. I really should have, but at that point, you just want the nightmare to end and get rid of any trace of the stuff in your house. P.S. if you still go ahead and try this, please recycle the container after washing it out. Cheers.",

Concentrated chlorine bleach, 12% hydrogen peroxide and janitorial grade ammonia, and oxy-clean powder… stains and overall dingy appearance persisted. Since already one foot in the trash, I mixed up about 1/4 cup of this in a pyrex container and added as little hot water as was necessary to submerge it all and let it soak overnight. I was braced for it to absolutely dissolve the garments into a milky sludge. Next morning, I couldn’t believe my eyes. The items came out an absolutely brilliant arctic white - every square centimeter … but otherwise undamaged or weakened… like new. Never seen anything like it. Don’t get it near anything colored, obviously.",

          'Had a clog due to pipe buildup associated with my garbage disposal. Bought this because both were listed as something this product would work for on the label. Seemed like it might be working so we used a second bottle as the instructions indicated, but the clog still did not clear. The plumber I then hired confirmed that yes, it was pipe buildup. My biggest issue is that it says "Guaranteed or it\'s free!" on the bottle and to go to this website for details, but there are no guarantee details on the site -- nothing on this product page and nothing comes up when I search for "guarantee" and similar phrases. Will likely NOT buy Drano again because when you say it\'s guaranteed, you should honor that.',

It foamed a lot and overflowed out of the drain, but when I checked back in an hour, it was completely gone. I poured a couple kettles of boiling water down and assumed everything worked perfectly. The next day, I realized it was draining even slower than before when I was showering. Now I have to let my landlord deal with it which I was trying to avoid. And I definitely wont try pouring anything else down that drain.",

Also, I thought, because it was a foam, it might clean the inside of the pipes better than the Max Gel. It didn't seem to clean the residue/build-up that I can see in the first few inches down my sink pipe at all. It does foam, and it does help with clogs and drainage, but it doesn't do what I was looking for it to do (clean and deodorize). Do not recommend and will not buy again.",

So definitely be prepared to see more fun than expected. I really like the fact that it’s dual action cleaning material. So you have two different types of liquid that makes us together to clean out your dream. You’re only supposed to use it in the sink in the bathroom or in the toilet. It doesn’t have any type of smell that I can sense so far. It does seem to be pretty dangerous if it gets close to children. It says if you come in contact with it to immediately rinse off as fast as possible. So I would say just be careful with this product but I’m definitely happy with it!",

As the shower has gotten old, calcium has started to fill cracks and surround the fittings. We thought this would be a good alternative to pulling the fittings apart and messing with the tile mud and grout. I never had good experience when I have tried the traditional liquid but this one is different as it doesn't seem to look for the easy quick route right way. I assume it helped that we waited until our shower was almost a bathtub but either way as you can see in the vid we have flowing water again and the growing stalagmites are still intact.",

          "I have a drain that slows down no matter how careful I am with what goes down it. Any drain cleaner I use, including the cheapest ones, opens it back up to where it drains quickly, once again. However, after a period of a few to several weeks, it slows back down. I figured I would try this more expensive (per volume) foaming drain cleaner. Well, it did the same thing as all the drain cleaners I had used previously - cleared it, then slowed back down (in short time). The only thing that goes down this drain is soap & water - and I always run clear pressurized water (via hose), afterward. Why it keeps slowing down is almost as mysterious as to how the pyramids were built. Anyway, if I'm going to spend money to get my drain running the way it should, I'll do the least expensive way - as long as the results are going to be the same. From my 1 use - I would definitely NOT recommend this product!",

          "The directions, which I read after I bought it, says not to use it for standing water, and they say to use another one of their products instead. Well, I waited for about 24 hours for the water to drain, and then used this. It says to leave it set for an hour. I left it overnight, while I was sleeping. When I woke up, I closed the drain and filled the sink with hot water (using the shower first to make sure the water WAS hot), and then opened the drain. It took awhile to open up, about halfway down, but then it suddenly started to flow a lot better. At least it wasn't still standing water all day! It worked well, but maybe I should have bought another bottle to see if it worked that much better with the sink draining just slowly as it was, rather than being entirely clogged up as it was. Instead of buying another bottle as I was going to, I happened to notice a Mainstays plunger that Wal-Mart was selling for only $2.98, which cost less than this bottle, so I decided to give it a try instead. Now, thanks to Drano and to the Mainstays plunger, my sink is draining so fast that when I close the sink and fill it up with hot water, and then open it to see how long it takes to drain, it swirls in the middle and when it gets down to the bottom,, it makes a loud swishing noise. You can't get any better than that!",

          "My bathroom sink had the worst slow drain I had ever seen. The entire sink was filling up just from brushing teeth. I tried everything on it, even other Drano types. This was a last ditch effort and even as I poured it into the drain, I was already grumbling my continued annoyance with this issue. I let it sit for quite some time before I sent some boiling water down after it. Twenty minutes later, I went in to use the sink and couldn't believe my eyes. Literally nothing had worked until this little foamy miracle. It's been over a week and still draining great. $4 for my sanity was money well spent.",

Much easier, didn't have to wait for things to boil, and didn't smell as bad as the vinegar. It sped up the flow for the drain. It's much faster now, must have been some caked on grease, and this seemed to take care of this. Was easy to use, just remove cap and make sure both halve pour some out.

          "Drano Dual Force Foamer Clog Remover works so much better on the pipes in this old house than the non foaming kind ever did. With Drano Dual Force Foamer Clog Remover I don't have to wait as long for it to activate and work, and I don't have to use it nearly as often to clear the pipes. With the Dual Force Foam, it slips in and settles in the pipes where the clog is, and then the foam activates and starts removing the clog by breaking it apart safely. Then you flush the pipes with hot water and you are done. It's amazing how fast and easy Drano Dual Force Foamer Clog Remover works. I used to have to use a clog remover every couple months because the hair build up in our pipes was horrendous. But with Drano Dual Force Foamer Clog Remover I now only have to use it a couple times a year, and it does all the work for me. I don't even have to snake the drain after anymore. The best part of it all is Drano Dual Force Foamer Clog Remover doesn't leave an annoying chemical smell behind either. That all washes down the drain with the hot water. However, I would not recommend it for counter tops or for stain removal or dusting. And it is not meant for disinfecting surfaces, just for clearing out clogged pipes.",

          "I have had a slow draining pipe in my kitchen sink for a few months. I didn't want to call the landlord who would then have to turn around call a professional. Eventually the sink got totally clogged and nothing would go through. I had no choice at that point but to try to get it unclogged myself. I bought this at the local hardware store. I figured two liquids have to be better than just one, right? Well, sort of. First of all when you pour the liquids out they are supposed to combine in the drain and work together to get the clog out, but one side is a liquid and one side is a gel. So naturally the liquid is going to pour right out, while the gel is going to come out slow. Eventually it all made it to the same place though, the clog. It took a while before it started to get things moving, probably around an hour, but it did the job. I was surprised because I didn't pay much for this product. In the future if the sink drains slow again, I will use this to help prevent it from becoming all the way clogged. Performance Although it's not a quick fix it, if you stay patient and let it do its work, the drain will more than likely get unclogged using this. Scent What drain cleaner is going to smell pleasant? It smells like any other drain cleaner smells, but it takes those chemicals to break down the junk in the sink, so I tolerate it.",

I figured that was as good as it was going to get, and this was just another disappointing drain cleaner. But about half an hour later I went back again and this time ran cold water through the drain for at least another five minutes. Surprise! The clog finally worked its way clear and the drain was working perfectly. The bottom line is that it took a lot longer than on the instructions (good luck trying to read the tiny print) and it wasn't as easy, but it finally did work.

The foamer works better than regular Drano, unless you have a completely clogged drain that doesn't move at all. Performance This product works great. The foaming of the two ingredients that are kept separate seems to make a big differnce from similar clog removers. I usually pour the product down the drain and give it a couple of hours to work before running hot water down the drain. I've used this and similar products in sinks and bathtubs around my house, and they always clear the drain on the first try. This product is a bit pricey, but you can usually get a coupon for it in a local paper or online, and it is much cheaper than hiring a plumber for a simple slow drain. Scent The scent is fine, not very strong since you pour it straight down the drain and then rinse it away within an hour or two.",

          "This is amazing clog remover. It is tough on clogs and clears drains quickly. Our bathroom sink was clogged because I have very long hair. This stuff was amazing and so easy to use. It cleared the clogged drain and was very powerful. My sink smelled fresh afterwards. It's a great product to have and I am confident that it will clear our drains in the future.",

(Way too many were dumped down the drain-large bowl full size) The sink was barely draining, so I poured this in the drain per instructions. About an hour later the clog was completely gone AND the sides of the drain pipe have been cleaned of all the nasty build-up! I’m amazed at how well this product worked and would def use it again and recommend it.",

I was surprised that there was not a strong chemical smell. After the hour I rinsed with hot water. Now my drain is back to normal and I for an added bonus the Drano cleaned my garbage disposal also.

When my spouse shaves, his little hairs really do a number on our drains. This seriously saves you a huge bill from the plumber. I try to stay on top of clogs, and purchase Drano ahead of when I need it. Seriously, buy one for those just in case moments which usually occur on Friday evenings or on weekends!",

Other products in the past just flushed through and I was back to square one again. This product is safe for all pipes, including kitchen (garbage disposals), bath, laundry room and won't harm the pipes like other products which may lead to corroding the pipes.",

Blessed with lots of hair in this family but makes for slow shower drain. Followed easy directions and after time elapsed I was able to see the difference in the drain time. Would recommend and buy again.",

My husband uses this once a month to prevent build up in our pipes. It is the only thing that has worked! We tried using other brand and we'd notice the water in out shower would start to drain slowly, showing build up in the pipes. Highly recommended for everyone's sake!",

They would stay at the top bringing grease back up. It eventually drains, and a little faster than it was. However I am completely unimpressed with this for use in a clogged kitchen drain.",

When I called a plumber and asked them to come they asked if I use any products and asked me to never do that again. Apparently a lot of these can be dangerous for them or interfere with the process that they need to do so I’ve never bought it since. I gave it three stars because if you’re willing to try it it will clear your drain for a little while.￼￼",

          "I hate it the sink gets clogged and it happens too often from the fallen hair congregating in the pipes. And consider my hair is of the thick variety, I can make strong netting out of it. So I needed something equally or more powerful than my superhuman hair in order to unclog my sink. That's when I decided to try **Drano Duel Force Foamer**. This 17 fl. oz. container lives up to its name as it contains both a gel and foam formula separated in its own compartment. Dual force treatment was needed for my stubborn sink and I'm glad this worked. It's quite easy to use. Slowly pour the entire content into the sink and let it sit for an hour. The gel is a thick liquid and meant to clear the clog while the foam helps remove any build-up. Together, they work quite effectively as a powerful clog-removing agent. After an hour, flush the sink with hot tap water. Keep in mind that this product is best if your sink isn't already filled with water. The thick gel will reach the drain but the foam will not. For a situation like that, it is recommended that a gel clog remover instead. This is a powerful treatment as the chemical contents can be quite dangerous. Never combine this with any other household products as hazardous gases may result from the mixing of these products. It is also wise to take great care when handling the liquids, as any contact with skin will burn you. I'm happy that **Drano Duel Force Foamer** worked for my sink. I usually but two gel cloggers in case it doesn't work the first time. With Drano Duel Force Foamer, that isn't the case at all. It gets the job done the first time round and definitely removes that hairball stuck in the pipes without a problem.",

We had a plumber out who informed us that Drano will degrade the insides of your pipes (fast!) causing more trouble after a while. Now, we have our drain cleaner come out a few times a year to clean and flush out the pipes and main drain. It ends up being cheaper in the long run and safer for our home.",

          "Hi, I bought this a few years ago when I moved into my first apartment, as a \"just in case\" type of thing. I never had to use it until now (about 3 years later). I turned my shower on to get the hot water ready.. and then when I finally was going to get into the show I saw that the tub was flooded (but I didn't cover the drain). I also have noticed in the past how the tub would flood DURING the shower.. but I thought nothing of it. But this time I finally decided to use the Drano. So I turned off the shower and poured the Drano in the drain.. and flushed it with hot water (as directed). Then after about a minute I started the shower again and was able to take the shower without dealing with a flooded tub. So, even after a few years it didn't go stale or anything. I didn't see an expiration date, but the labels are the only ones that worn off a bit over the years. The stuff actually works.. and fast. Yay!",
