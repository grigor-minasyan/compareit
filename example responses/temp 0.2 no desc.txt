Winner is: Liquid Plumr Foaming Pipe Snake Clog Remover
While both products have their pros and cons, Liquid Plumr Foaming Pipe Snake Clog Remover seems to have a higher success rate according to user reviews. It works well for removing clogs in bathroom sinks, tubs, and shower drains, and its foaming gel formula makes it stand out from traditional liquid drain cleaners. While it may not work as effectively on kitchen sink clogs, it has a guarantee for light clogs or slow drains and can save time and money by avoiding calling a plumber. Drano Dual Force Foamer Clog Remover also has its benefits, but its inconsistent results and chemical smell make it less appealing compared to Liquid Plumr.
